# Project Overview

An end-to-end deep learning project using Tensorflow and Keras where we read in a dataset of dog images, then train a convolutional neural network to classify them by breed.

File overview:

* `classifier.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook that loads the images and trains a neural network.

# Local Setup

## Installation

To follow this project, please install the following locally:

* JupyerLab
* Python 3.8+
* Python packages
    * tensorflow
    * Pillow
    * pandas
    * matplotlib
    

## Data

You'll need to download the dog image dataset to follow this project:

* [dog_images.zip](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1sj62C-9WKD09-8iYSeEvXmAGQoY2oFFQ) - please unzip this file into a folder called `images`.

The data is originally from [Stanford](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).  The original dataset has many more breeds included, which can be used to extend the analysis.
